/** 
 * @mainpage Acoustic Research Tool (ART) documentation
 *
 * @section sec_intro Introduction
 *
 * @subsection ss_sum Summary
 * 
 * ART is a flexible simulation framework for wind instruments. It includes a growing 
 * library of modelling elements. So far bore discontinuities, cylindrical and conical 
 * tubes, Bessel horns and bent tubes are available for frequency domain modelling.
 * 
 * This project is in its conceptual stage.
 * 
 * @ref sec_use "Skip the introduction and show me how to use it!"   
 * 
 * @subsection ss_spec Project specifications
 * 
 * The goal of this project is to provide an open, extendible and efficient acoustical 
 * simulation library which can be used by application programmers. This package should 
 * allow to realistically and efficiently model and simulate complicated and fairly 
 * general acoustical systems - especially wind instruments with or without tone holes 
 * and eventually the singing or speaking voice - in the frequency domain as well as in 
 * the time domain.
 * 
 * Special focus should be put on efficiency because computer optimisation may require 
 * many thousands of evaluations of virtual instruments which are usually only slightly 
 * modified between successive analysis steps by an optimiser application program. Time 
 * domain modelling often requires generating real time sound when parameters of the 
 * sound generator are modified.
 * 
 * Nevertheless, modelling accuracy and physical realism should be another major 
 * concern. The package should contain most accurate models for the frequency domain as 
 * well as for the time domain because it is a main goal of this project to provide the 
 * core of new and accurate tools for instrument makers as well as for scientists who 
 * want to study the influence of faint differences in geometry or other acoustical 
 * boundary conditions on sound and playability of musical instruments or on resonance 
 * frequencies, damping conditions and other properties of travelling or standing waves 
 * in general acoustical systems.
 * 
 * A main application which makes use of the library's frequency domain modeling will be 
 * the computer optimisation of general acoustical systems in terms of resonance and 
 * radiation characteristics, damping and excitation properties. Applied to musical 
 * instruments these characteristics are called intonation, sound quality, efficiency 
 * and playability. The library's time domain simulation mode will be used for 
 * synthesizing sounds of more or less simplified up to nearly realistic virtual 
 * instruments depending on the required tradeoff between accuracy and computation 
 * speed. By controlling various model parameters in real time articulation and 
 * phonation can be studied in virtual singers and speakers.
 * 
 * The library will be programmed in ANSI C++ with no assumptions about or dependencies 
 * of operating system or computer architecture. The Class dependencies will be defined 
 * in UML in order to enforce proper interplay and to make it easier to keep 
 * documentation and implementation consistent and extensible. Models have to register 
 * their parameters, usage details and documentary text in order to allow applications 
 * being independent of the implementation status of the library.
 * 
 * Applications written in any programming language should be able to easily access the 
 * library's functionality. All graphical and user interface related issues will have to 
 * be handled by the application program, otherwise complete platform independence would 
 * not be achievable.
 * 
 * The developing process will be a multi-national effort with independent contributions 
 * of several researchers, co-ordinated by a small board of experienced acousticians and 
 * software developers continuously communicating by means of a dedicated online forum 
 * hosted by the TC-MA of the EAA (the workgroup area). Concepts, documentation, sources 
 * and prototype applications will be made available, too. Contributions in terms of 
 * comments, ideas, conceptual proposals as well as actual C-code are highly welcome.
 * 
 * @subsection ssec_status Project Status (Version 0.10)
 *   
 * This project is still in an early stage. Nevertheless a preliminary working release has 
 * already been published. Although the concept does include other simulation domains, 
 * only frequency and a limited number of time domain models have been
 * implemented up to now. The currently existing
 * code allows to calculate input impedances of arbitrary bore profiles consisting of 
 * cylindrical sections, conical sections, bessel horn sections, exponential horn 
 * sections, bent cylindrical and conical tubes, bore discontinuities and branches (tone 
 * holes). All elements (except for the branch) take multi-modal wave propagation of an 
 * arbitrary number of modes into account. The very common case of 1 (plane wave), 2 or 3 
 * modes has been optimised for performance. Lossless as well as lossy wave propagation is 
 * available for all elements. Simulation parameters like air temperature, humidity and 
 * carbon dioxide content as well as a separate boundary layer loss factor can be 
 * specified for each individual section of the bore profile. Termination impedances can 
 * be chosen from a range of predefined radiation models.
 *
 * In the time domain, basic modules for Digital Waveguides (DWGs) have been implemented.
 * The current release includes DWGs for
 * - Cylindrical bores / fractional delays (@ref DWGcylinderModule),
 * - Cylindrical junctions (@ref DWGcylinderJunctionModule),
 * - Conical bores (@ref DWGconeModule) and
 * - Conical bore junctions (@ref DWGconeJunctionModule).
 * Moreover, several standard modules (sine wave, heaviside, amplification, etc.)
 * which are commonly used in any time-domain simulation have been implemented.
 * The most flexible module is the @ref inputFunctionModule which is able to
 * calculate the output based on any given mathematical formula and multiple inputs.
 * As by version 0.10, only the @ref sp_API "ART programmer's interface" implements
 * the time-domain simulation.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_tb Theoretical background 
 *
 * One way to describe the acoustic characteristics of wind instruments is the input 
 * impedance. The input impedance, as a function of frequency, describes which frequency
 * components will be attenuated by the instrument. It depends on the shape of the 
 * instrument and can be calculated by dividing the instrument into pieces of the 
 * following types:
 *
 * A <B>Cylinder</B> is characterised by its radius and length.
 * @image html cyl.png
 * @image latex cyl_l.pdf "Parameters of a cylinder module."
 * A <B>Bore jump</B> must be inserted, where two sections with different perimeter meet. It is
 * only characterised by radius 1 and 2. 
 * @image html bj.png
 * @image latex bj_l.pdf "Parameters of a bore jump module."
 * A <B>Cone</B> is described by its length, radius 1 and 2. The perimeter increase of the
 * perimeter is linear.
 * @image html cone.png
 * @image latex cone_l.pdf "Parameters of a cone module."
 * A <B>Bessel horn</B> is defined by its length, radius 1, radius 2 and the flare 
 * parameter. The increase of the perimeter is non-linear. Use the flare parameter to
 * change the curvature. See Braden 2006, p. 132 for detailed formulae.
 * @image html bessel.png
 * @image latex bessel_l.pdf "Parameters of a bessel horn."
 * A <B>tone hole</B> is a branch to a cylinder with an open end. Tone holes can only
 * be inserted between two other elements.   
 * @image html tonehole.png
 * @image latex tonehole_l.pdf "Parameters of a tone hole module."
 * 
 * A <B>termination element</B> can only be added at the end of the element. Use termination
 * elements to choose the radiation impedance. The radius r defines the radius of the circular
 * radiating surface. 
 * 
 * @image html termination.png
 * @image latex termination_l.pdf "Parameters of a termination module." width=0.5cm
 *
 * The cylinder and the cone are also available as bent elements. An additional property,
 * the bend radius, describes the curvature of the bend.  
 *   
 * In the programme the user can use these models to build an instrument in order to
 * calculate its input impedance.
 *  
 * @section sec_use Using the Acoustic Research Tool
 * 
 * ART comes in two flavours: As a command line tool and as a programmer's library. As a
 * command line tool ART can be embedded in the TAP framework. An executable for Windows 
 * and source code are provided. The programmer's library
 * provides an interface for implementing applications for impedance calculation. For this
 * we provide a Windows DLL and source code, which you can include in your projects.

/** 
 * @page sp_ACT Using the ART command line tool
 * 
 * The ART command line tool provides a simple and quick interface for calculating the
 * impedance of musical instruments. The programme can receive input from the binary input
 * stream and sends output to the binary output stream. Use the programme in pipes with
 * other executables to provide input (a frequency range) and process output (impedance 
 * curves). Such executables can be found in the Toolbox for Analysis and Prototyping (TAP).
 * The TAP framework is a collection of small programmes that can be used to create stimulus 
 * signals like frequency sweeps over a certain frequency range and process binary output.
 * 
 * @section s_setup Setup of ART and TAP
 *  
 * @subsection ss_inst Installation 
 *  
 *  - Extract zipped archive to a local folder (e.g. "C:\TAP").
 *  - DoubleClick "C:\TAP\command completion (HKCU-NT shell).reg" to turn on filename completion with TAB-key
 *  - RightClick/Install "C:\TAP\DOSHERE.INF" to enter a "DOS Prompt Here" command to your explorer's folder 
 *	context menu
 *  - Use Settings/ControlPanel/System/Extended/Environment Variables/ to prepend "C:\TAP;" to the system 
 *	variable named "Path" (it might now be necessary to logoff and logon again to make your changes effective)
 * 
 * @subsection ss_vinst Verify the Installation
 * 
 *  - Open a command shell using the explorer's context menu of some (empty) folder.
 *  - enter "path" at the command prompt to see whether "C:\TAP" is the first entry in your path system variable.
 *  - enter "stim | envsort | plot" to check whether everything is working. A GNUPlot window with a sinewave 
 *	should open.
 * 
 * @section s_run Running the simulator
 *  
 *  The following command will simulate the input impedance of a straight tube of 100 cm length 
 *  and 0.5 cm radius and send the frequency and magnitude columns of the resulting binary 
 *  stream to the plot program. The programme will simulate the tube at equally spaced 
 *  frequencies between 50 Hz and 1000 Hz with 5 Hz increment and won't read the input stream.
 *
 *  @verbatim
art -freq 50 1000 5 -cyl 100 0.5 | plot -sig 3 -xcol 1 -ycol 2 -nam ImpMag -xu [Hz] -yu [acOhm] -tit "Tube 1m"
    @endverbatim
 *
 *
 *  To do the same and see a numerical table with three columns (f, mag, arg) instead of 
 *  plotting the binary stream, type:
 *
 *  @verbatim
art -freq 50 1000 5 -cyl 100 0.5 | bin2flo -columns 3 -nocount 
    @endverbatim
 *
 *  To do the same but calculate resonant frequencies and magnitudes instead of generating a binary plot stream:
 *
 *  @verbatim
art -freq 50 1000 5 1 -cyl 100 0.5
    @endverbatim
 *
 *  To simulate a complete trumpet described in an @ref s_instfiles "instrument file", type:
 *
 *  @verbatim
art -freq 50 1000 5 -list trumpet.ins | plot -sig 3 -xcol 1 -ycol 2 -nam ImpMag -xu Hz -yu Ohm -tit "Trumpet"
    @endverbatim
 * 
 *  @section s_instfiles Instrument file format
 *
 *  The programme defines its instruments in a top-down, object-oriented approach. The .ins
 *  file-format likewise represents instruments in this manner. An instrument consists of a
 *  list of elements describing its geometry, each of which has parameters specifying the
 *  exact dimensions.

 * @page sp_API Using the ART programmer's interface 
 *
 * @section incl Including the ART interface
 *  
 * Windows programmers can use the DLL. C++ programmers can include the ART.h file.
 *	
 * @subsection dll Using the DLL
 * 
 * If you are working on windows and not using C++, you can use a DLL. The DLL can be 
 * downloaded from the sourceforge site. If you prefer to compile the DLL by yourself,
 * use the MakeARTDLL.bat make file script. Check the Delphi examples on source forge to
 * find out how to use the DLL.	
 *
 * @subsection arth Including ART.h
 * 
 * When working in C++, simply include the ART.h file into your project. Don't forget to
 * add all files of the ART package as dependencies. So far only compiling on Microsoft
 * Visual C++ 6.0 has been tested, other compilers could work. We are still working on 
 * making the code portable to other compilers and platforms. Check out the source forge
 * page if you want to get the source code.  
 *   
 * @section use Using the ART interface 
 *
 * @subsection pemh Models - Prototypes - Elements - Circuits
 *
 * It is important to grasp the difference between a model, a prototype and an element.

<B>Models</B> provide functions to prepare the calculation of their own acoustic properties. The data properties of a model are its physical features, like length, width or temperature. Other properties concern implementation details, like for which simulation domain and which wavetypes the model provides calculation functions. A model has to implement the ARTmodelInterface.  

<B>Prototypes</B> (or "prototype models") are models, that are instantiated during the initialization of the ART root object. Each of these prototype models contains meaningful default values. Prototypes serve as templates to create other models of the same class during runtime. Theses clones are attached to elements (see below), which you can insert into circuits and use for calculation. 

<B>Elements</B> are wrappers of models and can be used for simulation. Their properties, like input impedance or radiation impedance, are dependent on their place in a circuit. Elements contain their own model object (which is a clone of a prototype model).

 * <B>Circuits</B> are arrangements of acoustic elements. When simulating a musical instrument, 
 * you will have to build a circuit to represent that instrument closely. A circuit must 
 * contain one or more elements. So far elements can only be arranged in in a one   
 * dimensional way, branches (with the notable excepetion of tone holes) are not (yet) possible. 

When calculation the impedance of a cylindrical tube, you would first create an element. When creating an element of type cylinder, the cylinder prototype is automatically cloned and the clone is attached to the element as its model. Then you would adapt the properties of the element's model, place the element into a circuit within the same simulator and evaluate the circuits impedance. When computing the impedance, the element will use the functions provided by its model.
 
 * @subsection step2a Creating the simulator
 *
 * First the user must create the ART root object. This object will contain all simulators and
 * provides us with all prototypes.  
 * Then the user has to create a simulator for a certain wave type and a certain 
 * simulation domain. So far only frequency domain and multimodal waves are supported, so
 * we will create a simulator for that and save a pointer to it:
 * @code
 * ARTRootObject(); 
 * P_ART_Simulator mySim = ARTCreateSimulator("MySimulator", "FrequencyDomain", "MultiModal"); 
 * @endcode  
 *	
 * @subsection step2 Creating the elements
 * 
 * Elements are created from prototypes and placed into a simulator by the function 
 * ARTCreateElement. The prototypes need to provide functions for simulation in the 
 * simulator's domain and wavetype. We will create a cylinder and call it "Cyl", a cone
 * called "Con" and a Bessel horn named "Bes", all in the simulator created before. 
 * @code
 * P_ART_Element Cyl = ARTCreateElement(mySim, "Cyl", "Cylinder");
 * P_ART_Element Con = ARTCreateElement(mySim, "Con", "Cone");
 * P_ART_Element Bes = ARTCreateElement(mySim, "Bes", "Besselhorn");
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @subsection step3 Customising the elements
 *	
 * To change the measurements and other parameters of the elements use the function
 * ARTSetParameter. We well change the measurements of the cylinder to a 100 cm long tube
 * with a radius of 1 cm. The cone will be 50 cm long, and have the same radius as
 * the cylinder at the beginning and 1.5 times that radius at the end. The Bessel horn 
 * will be 20 cm long, have the same radius as the cone ending and bend to a radius of 
 * 12.5 cm at the end. The parameter flare, controlling the shape 
 * of the Bessel horn is set to 0.4.
 * @code
 * ARTSetParameter(mySim, "Cyl.r = 1; Cyl.length = 100;"); 
 * ARTSetParameter(mySim, "Con.length = 50;"); 
 * ARTSetParameter(mySim, "Con.r1 = Cyl.r; Con.r2 = 1.5 * Con.r1;"); 
 * ARTSetParameter(mySim, "Bes.length = 20; Bes.r1 = Con.r2;");
 * ARTSetParameter(mySim, "Bes.r2 = 12.5; Bes.flare = 0.4;"); 
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection step4 Building the instrument
 * 
 * The order in which the elements are added is
 * important. The first element will be the element nearest to the mouth of the player. 
 * Use the functions ARTAppendReferenceBefore and ARTAppendReferenceAfter if you want to
 * insert elements at a certain place. We will first create an instrument and then
 * add our customised elements one by one.
 * 
 * @code
 * P_ART_Circuit myIns = ARTCreateCircuit(mySim, "MyInstrument");
 * ARTAppendReference(myIns, Cyl);
 * ARTAppendReference(myIns, Con);
 * ARTAppendReference(myIns, Bes);
 * @endcode
 *	
 * @subsection step5 Calculating the instrument's impedance
 * 
 * Before calculating the impedance the frequency range and the number of modes have to be
 * defined. The impedance is evaluated for discrete points within the range. The distance
 * between these points is determined by the frequency step. We will set the range of the
 * simulator to be from 50 Hz to 1800 Hz, with a frequency step of 5 Hz. We set the number 
 * of modes to 1.
 * 
 * @code	
 * ARTSetFrequencyRange(mySim, 50, 1800, 5);
 * ARTSetNModes(mySim, 1);
 * @endcode
 *
 * To calculate a circuit's impedance we simply use the function ARTInputImpedance. The 
 * impedance curve returned won't change if the arrangement is changed after the function
 * is called. A new call ensures the impedance curve is up-to-date. The function returns
 * a pointer to an object of class ARTdataContainer, which holds the data.
 *
 * We will have the impedance of our instrument calculated and print it as numbers to the
 * screen.
 *

 * @endcode
 * 
 * @subsection step6 Cleaning up
 * 
 * When you are done you must destroy all elements and simulators you create and
 * also the ART root object: 
 *    
 * @code	
 * ARTDestroyCircuit(mySim, myIns);
 * ARTDestroyElement(mySim, Cyl);
 * ARTDestroyElement(mySim, Con);
 * ARTDestroyElement(mySim, Bes);
 * ARTDestroySimulator(mySim);
 * ARTRootDestroy();
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @section sec3 Error handling
 * 
 * When errors are encountered, the interface either throws an exception as an object of    
 * the class ARTerror (when not using the DLL) or returns a bad value through a function 
 * (when using the DLL).
 * 
 * When not using the DLL, include critical operations in try/catch blocks, like this:
 * @code
 * try
 * {
 *	ARTRootObject();
 *	P_ART_Simulator mySim = ARTCreateSimulator("MySim", "FrequencyDomain", "MultiModal");
 *	ARTCreateElement(mySim, "Zylinder1", "Cylinder");
 *	ARTSetParameter(mySim, "Cyl.R = 10;"); //Error! There's no element called "Cyl"!
 * }
 * catch(ARTerror e)
 * {	
 *	string err = e.GetErrorMessage();
 *	std::cout << err; 
 *	//Will print: 
 *	//"Error in function 'ARTSetParameter': An element of the specified name 'Cyl' does not exist."
 * }
 * @endcode  
 * Of course it does not harm to include all operations in try/catch blocks. At this stage
 * of the project that can be useful for debugging. Note that most error messages so far are 
 * indeed rather for debugging and not meant for end-users.
 *
 * @see ARTerror   
 * @see ARTGetLastErrorMessage to find out more about error handling when using the DLL. 
 *   	
 * @section sec2 Technicalities
 *
 * @subsection susec1 The dependency tree
 *   
 * When the impedance is evaluated, first all parameters it depends on are evaluated. If
 * those parameters depend themselves on other parameters, they are evalauted before. All
 * parameters are in a dependency tree, which the programme automatically follows to its
 * principle elements, those that do not depend on any other parameter. In our example the
 * dependency tree looks as follows:
 * 
 * @image html dependencies.png
 * @image latex dependencies_l.pdf
 *   
 * So when the impedance is queried, all other properties are evaluated first. 
 * Therefore the user never has to worry about evaluating other properties before calling
 * ARTInputImpedance.
 * 
 * Properties keep track of their validity. As soon as a dependency of a property is 
 * changed, the property is marked for recalculation the next time it is needed.	
 *   
 * @subsection susec4 Progress information and computation cost estimation
 * 
 * The user can specify a callback function, which will be called at regular intervals 
 * during the calculation process to communicate information about the progress. This 
 * function can also be used to abort the calculation. Before the calculation starts, the
 * interface determines the cost of the computation in computation steps, that is parser or functionoid calls 
 * respectively. Since not all of these operations are of the same complexity the first
 * thousand computation steps can be twice as fast as the following thousand.

 *  
 * @section pg_intro Introduction
 * 
 * This is the top level page of the source code documentation. 
 * These pages are the documentation of ART's sources. If you want to contribute to the 
 * project you will find useful background information here. Some sections of the user's
 * manual may also bring you to these pages, since some details of ART's functionality are
 * explained here. 
 *  
 * If you only want to use ART without extending its functionality, have a look at these
 * pages: 
 *          
 * @ref sp_ACT "Using the ART command line tool"
 *  
 * @ref sp_API "Using the ART programmer's interface"	
 *
 * @section pg_overview Overview
 * 
 * The source code can be divided into several units:
 * 
     - The @ref ARTinterface_group "ART programmer's interface" provides simple functions which allow you to build your 
       own simulation applications. 
   
     - The @ref ARTimpl "ART objects" are the objects the programmer's interface is built on. You can
       also build your own applications by using these objects.   
   
     - The @ref ARTmodelInterfaceGroup "ART model interface" is being developped to provide an easy way of adding custom
       models to ART.
   
     - The @ref waveObjectInterfaceGroup "wave interface" standardizes a way of converting different types of waves as
       they are required by the models. 
 *  
 *
 * @section enhancing Enhancing the Acoustic Research Tool 
 * 
 * @subsection calc_Imp Behind the scenes of ARTInputImpedance
 * 
 * This section was written to give you an idea about how the calculation 
 * actually works, which is essential if you plan to integrate your own models in ART.
 * 
 * Do you remember the difference between elements, models and prototypes? Then 
 * you might also remember that every element has its own model attached to it 
 * and that every model implements the ARTmodelInterface. Now what happens when 
 * we call ARTinputImpedance?
 * 
 * ARTInputImpedance calls the method PrepareCalculation of the specified 
 * circuit. That function uses the interface functions of the models of each 
 * element to prepare the calculation. The outermost element is queried for its 
 * radiation impedance. The radiation impedance is then propagated through all 
 * elements until the input impedance at the mouthpiece has been found.
 * 
 * It is important to note that calculation does not take place in this step. In 
 * fact, the circuit prepares the calculation by setting up relations between the 
 * elements and laying down how the values of all the propagated impedances have 
 * to be calculated.
 * 
 * Let's assume we want to calculate the input impedance of a simple model, 
 * consisting of a cylinder (the mouth piece) a cone and a Bessel horn at the 
 * outer end (the "radiating" end). In our simple model the circuit tells the Besselhorn element to provide a 
 * waveobject representing its radiation impedance. This waveobject is still 
 * empty when passed to the Besselhorn to get a waveobject representing the 
 * propagated impedance. The element only notes which waveobject to propagate 
 * when calculation is finally carried out. The new waveobject is passed to the 
 * cone, which returns a representation of the propagated impedance, which is 
 * again passed on to the cylinder to get the impedance propagated through the 
 * last element (or the first, from the player's perspective). This waveobject 
 * will contain the input impedance.
 * 
 * @image html instrument_waveobj.png
 * @image latex instrument_waveobj_l.pdf
 * 
 * When these relations are set up, the circuit is ready for calculation. The 
 * input impedance is queried for its value and since it is not up-to-date, it 
 * initiates its own computation. By asking each dependency for its value it 
 * initiates their computation. This sets off a chain reaction during which all 
 * waveobjects are evaluated, starting from the radiation impedance and ending 
 * with the input impedance of the circuit, which was queried in the beginning.
 * 
 * @image html waveobjects_evaluation.png
 * @image latex waveobjects_evaluation_l.pdf
 * 
 * A little but important detail are the waveobjects themselves. Waveobjects 
 * contain the wave in some form (as impedance per frequency, as pressure per 
 * frequency, as an impulse in the time domain, etc.) and implement the 
 * WaveObjectInterface. The interface declares functions which the models can use 
 * to ensure the wave is provided in a certain form, the waveobjects need to 
 * prepare this conversion.
 * 
 * The calculations themselves are carried out by functionoids. If you are not 
 * familiar with the concept of functionoids, imagine them to be deep-frozen 
 * function calls. That is, all necessary arguments are passed to a functionoid's 
 * constructur. The constructor saves references or pointers to those arguments 
 * but does not compute anything. Only when the functionoid's core function 
 * (we've called it applyFunction) is called, the calculation is executed.
 * 
 * The reason for introducing these concepts is efficiency. The ART interface was 
 * written with different types of applications in mind, and in some, like 
 * optimizers, it is common to reevaluate an instrument's input impedance 
 * frequently after doing only minor changes. Impedance calculations of whole 
 * instruments can be very time consuming, so we want to avoid recalculating 
 * values which have no reason to change. If, for example, in our simple example 
 * instrument only the length of the cylinder changed, we would not need to 
 * recompute the Bessel horn's or the cone's impedance, but only propagate the 
 * input impedance at the entrance of the cone through the changed cylinder.
 * 
 * @subsection ownModel How to implement your own model
 * 
 * To implement your own model, derive a class from ARTmodelInterface and 
 * implement the declared functions. If a model is not supposed to support a 
 * certain functionality, throw an exception (of type ARTerror) in the function 
 * to inform users and programmers, that the requested functionality is not 
 * available.
 * 
 * Methods like InputImpedance or RadiationImpedance are supposed to *prepare* 
 * waveobjects for calculation. Therefore, a model must implement the calculation 
 * itself in functionoids. Only the constructors of these custom functionoids 
 * should be called in the methods derived from ARTmodelInterface.
 * 
 * Look at the models implemented so far (HornElementPrototype_FD and ToneHole) 
 * for examples. Both classes are wrappers for other objects of class HornElement 
 * and use the HornElement-object's methods to calculate acoustic impedance. Note 
 * how the functionoids are used in the two classes.
 * 
 * @subsection useOwnModel How to use your own model
 * 
 * To use your own model and make it useable for others, you have to construct a 
 * protoype with your model. Set properties of the prototype in its constructor. 
 * Check the ToneHole constructor to see an example.
 * 
 * That prototype must be added to the prototpeModels list of the ART root object 
 * in the root object's constructor. That is as simple as this:
 * 
 * @code 
 *   obj = prototypeModels->AppendObject(new ToneHole()); 
 * @endcode
 * 
 * The prototype will then be available as a template for elements. When the root 
 * object is detroyed, the prototype will also be destroyed (properties, objects 
 * and methods appended to an ARTobject are always destroyed when the object is 
 * destroyed).
 * 
 * If you can not specify all properties of a prototype in its constructor (for 
 * example when creating a template class to represent a prototype that will have 
 * different properties depending on the template argument) you can add the 
 * properties after instantiation of the prototype object in the root object's 
 * constructor. The cylinder, for example, is created like that:
 * 
 * @code 
 *   obj = prototypeModels->AppendObject(
 *     new HornElementPrototype_FD<CylinderSection>("Cylinder", "sound propagation in a cylindrical duct")
 *     ); 
 *   //physical properties with values are data properties 
 *   obj->AppendDataProp("length", 100.0, "axial length"); 
 *   obj->AppendDataProp("r", 1.0,"duct radius"); 
 *   obj->AppendDataProp("temp", 21.0,"local temperature"); 
 *   obj->AppendDataProp("loss", 1.0,"loss factor (defaults to 1)"); 
 *   //what the cylinder can do is specified by its properties
 *   obj->AppendMethod("SphericalWave", "MapesRiordan Model"); 
 *   obj->AppendMethod("PlaneWave", "first mode only"); 
 *   obj->AppendMethod("MultiModal", "modal decomposition up to n modes (Kemp02)"); 
 *   obj->AppendMethod("FrequencyDomain", "simulation in frq domain"); 
 *   obj->AppendProperty("canPropagate","this element can propagate impedance"); 
 *   obj->AppendProperty("canRadiate","this radiation impedance of this element can be calculated"); 
 * @endcode
 *

 * @section about_researchers Researchers contributing to the project
 *
 * In 2002 <b>Jonathan Kemp</b> published his thesis "Theoretical and experimental study of wave
 * propagation in brass musical instruments" (Univ. of Edinburgh) containing a
 * comprehensive review of the theory of multimodal wave propagation and extending it to
 * include ducts with rectangular cross-section (ready to be implemented).
 *
 * The basic concepts for the simulation framework of the ART project have been presented
 * at the ViennaTalk 2005 by <b>Wilfried Kausel</b>, who founded the WG2 at the subsequent TCMA
 * meeting in Budapest in order to trigger an international collaboration for the
 * collection of existing and future physical models with the aim of integrating them into
 * a common framework to make them more generally available and useful.
 *
 * In 2006 <b>Alistair Braden</b> contributed the first C++ code as part of his thesis "Bore
 * Optimisation and Impedance Modelling of Brass Musical Instruments" (Univ. of
 * Edinburgh). He extended the theory of multimodal wave propagation to include bent
 * cylindrical tubes and he implemented straight and bent cylinders and cones, bessel
 * horns, exponential sections and bore discontinuities. His code was ported to Windows by
 * Kausel who also optimised its performance and included local simulation parameters like
 * temperature and boundary loss factor. He also started to create the application
 * interface layer by adding the parameter dependency tree and by implementing the "self-
 * documentation feature" of all available models and parameters.
 *
 * During an internship at the University of Music in Vienna <b>Delphine Chadefaux</b> added
 * branch elements (tone holes) and she implemented the "matrix accumulation concept" as
 * an optional alternative to the "impedance back-propagation concept" which turned out to
 * be numerically more stable and which allows to cache the system matrix of a bigger
 * section of the bore profile (e.g. the bell) when this is not to be modified during
 * series of impedance recalculations. She also improved the model for the speed of sound
 * in air taking relative humidity and carbon dioxide content into account.
 *
 * In 2009 <b>Vasileios Chatziioannou</b> became a member of the acoustic research team at the
 * University of Music in Vienna and he is now in charge of the simulation kernel. He
 * improved the code significantly by fixing many remaining bugs, straightening out and
 * documenting the code. He also added the thermo-viscous loss model of straight tubes to
 * the bent tube and cone sections which were lossless before.
 *
 * In 2011 <b>Sadjad Siddiq</b> was working on the programmers' interface. He
 * implemented the caching algorithm, integrated the expression parser, introduced the wave
 * objects and models interface and compiled the documentation. 
 *
 * In 2012 <b>Clemens Geyer</b>, a master level student at the University of Music in Vienna, was
 * responsible for reestablishing the GCC- and Linux compatibility and
 * added time domain processing to the simulation core.
